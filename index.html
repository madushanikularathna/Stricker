              <h3>About the program</h3>
              <p>
                  The ‘Community Strikers’ programme is about helping communities to strengthen their income and build an alternative revenue stream which can be done from the comfort of your home. It is a simple business model which rewards the ‘Community Striker’ simply based on their ability to sell more.
                  The programme is brought to life considering the inflation levels and also the need felt for an additional source of income for the household.
                  The programme also attempts to bring to life more sustainable entrepreneurship models which can benefit both product and the ‘community striker’ in a sustainable and stable financial model.
                  Rs. 55/- profit per can you sell (16% profit margin)</p>

                   <p>Unlike other FMCG products where you need to sell larger volumes to increase the total cash inflow, the profitability 
                     offered by Red Bull for each can at Rs. 55/-, will help you earn more with reasonable volume metrics, 
                     ensuring less time spent on revenue.</p> 
                
                  
                    <p>Also earn Rs. 20/- per can as a commission of each can sale of your team<br></p>
                     <p>Not only that, you can promote the business to your friends and family to create a team of ‘community strikers’ where
                      you become a team leader. And you will earn Rs. 20/- for every can your team members are selling as a commission. This
                       reward is for ‘community strikers’ who want to go the extra mile, and also generate more revenue.<br>
                       You see all your team members sales calculated on your screen. You can redeem against cans or collect
                       in cash by the 2nd week of each month.</p>  
                      <p>And more support,
                  All you have to do is to register and place the order, because you will get door-step delivery within 48 hours for Colombo 1-15,
                  within 72 hours for <b>kelaniya, Kadawatha, Wattala, moratuwa, Piliyandala, 96 hours - hanwella, kahathuduwa, athurugiriya,Padukka, Kaduwela, hanwella</b> and the plus side is, the product is already the leader in energy drinks and also a well-known household name supported by advertising and BTL.
